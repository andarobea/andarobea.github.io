                <p>The house takes its name from Habsburg Castle, a fortress built in the 1020s in present-day Switzerland by Radbot of Klettgau, who 
                    named his fortress Habsburg. His grandson Otto II was the first to take the fortress name as his own, adding "Count of Habsburg" to 
                    his title. In 1273, Count Radbot's seventh-generation descendant Rudolph of Habsburg was elected King of the Romans. Taking advantage
                    of the extinction of the Babenbergs and of his victory over Ottokar II of Bohemia at the battle on the Marchfeld in 1278,<br> 
                    he appointed his sons as Dukes of Austria and moved the family's power base to Vienna, where the Habsburg dynasty gained the name 
                    of "House of Austria" and ruled until 1918.</p>
                    <p>The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs from 1440 until their extinction in the male line
                         in 1740 and, after the death of Francis I, from 1765 until its dissolution in 1806. The house also produced kings of Bohemia,
                          Hungary, Croatia, Spain, Portugal and Galicia-Lodomeria, with their respective colonies; rulers of several principalities in the 
                          Low Countries and Italy; and in the 19th century, emperors of Austria and of Austria-Hungary as well as one emperor of Mexico. 
                          The family split several times into parallel branches, most consequentially in the mid-16th century between its Spanish and Austria
                          n branches following the abdication of Charles V. Although they ruled distinct territories, the different branches nevertheless
                           maintained close relations and frequently intermarried.
                        Members of the Habsburg family oversee the Austrian branch of the Order of the Golden Fleece and the Imperial and Royal Order of 
                        Saint George. The current head of the family is Karl von Habsburg.</p>

                    Born as a duchess, best known as <em style="color: rgb(178, 4, 4);"">Empress Sisi</em>, Elizabeth of Austria was way ahead of her time. She was a rebel, always looking for ways to escape the strict protocol of the Habsburg court, and her mother-in-law.
    
                    Her story is well known through many books and films. Most of the time they paint a romantic picture that could not be further from  reality. Sisi was beautiful, but also depressed, lonely, misunderstood and probably suffering from eating disorder.
                    
                    In the end, she is stabbed to death at age 66. She dies alone, except for some servants. Her son is dead, her daughters and husband are detached from her, and she spends her last years travelling the world to find salvage.
                    Her Royal Highness Duchess Elisabeth Amalie Eugenie was born on Christmas eve on 24 December 1837. She grew up at Possenhofen Castle on the shore of Lake Starnberg in Bavaria, Germany. The family called her Sisi. 
    
                    Her father was  Maximillian, Duke in Bavaria; since there could only be one Duke of Bavaria all the other members of the Wittelsbach family used the title Duke in Bavaria. 
                    Her mother was a real Princess; Princess Ludovika of Bavaria was the sixth child of King Maximilian I of Bavaria and Queen Caroline. They were second cousins and the marriage was arranged by their fathers. 
    
                    Their marriage was not as happy as depicted in the Sissi films. Maximilian had many mistresses and extramarital children. Over the years the relationship improved, especially when Ludovika kind of accepted the affairs of her husband and his frequent absence.
                    The childhood of Elisabeth of Bavaria was happy and free, with enough time for horse riding and swimming in the lake with her seven surviving siblings.
                    She probably also played with the illegitimate children of Duke max. He had many, and some of them often visited at Possenhofen.
                    
                    It was said he even preferred the company of his illegitimate children above that of the children he had with Ludovika.
                    
                    Schloss Possenhofen is currently privately owned and has luxurious apartments in it. It is not open to the public but walking around the Starnberger lake you can get a good look at the castle.
                    Sisi gave birth to four children. The first two were daughters; Sophie (5 March 1855) and Gisela (15 July 1856). Archduchess Sophie immediately took control over the children, taking them away from the care of their mother. Sisi should spend all her time doing her duties as the Empress of Austria.
                    In 1857 Sisi took both her children on a trip to Hungary, against the advice of both Sophie and the Court physicians since the children were not well.
    
                    The trip ended in a tragedy. Princess Sophie died, probably of typhus, only three years old. This caused the first of Sisi's many depressions and of course reinforced the opinion of the Archduchess that Elisabeth of Bavaria was not fit for motherhood and should not be in charge of the royal children.
                    In 1858 Sisi finally gave birth to the long-awaited Crown Prince.  Prince Rudolf was born on August 21, 1858 in Laxemburg Castle, and was also taken away from Sisi immediately.  He was raised by tutors and at the early age of six, Rudolf started his education to become emperor of Austria. Sisi  was blocked out of the upbringing and education of her children.
    
                    Since she had no control over the most aspects of her personal life empress Sisi started to work on her own body. Through rigid workouts, fastening and tight lacing she got the slender wasp waste looks that she is famous for.

                <em style="color: rgb(178, 4, 4);">Franz Joseph</em>, also called Francis Joseph, (born August 18, 1830, Schloss Schönbrunn, near Vienna, Austria—died November 21, 1916, Schloss Schönbrunn), emperor of Austria (1848–1916) and king of Hungary (1867–1916), who divided his empire into the Dual Monarchy, in which Austria and Hungary coexisted as equal partners. In 1879 he formed an alliance with Prussian-led Germany,
                 and in 1914 his ultimatum to Serbia led Austria and Germany into World War I. Franz Joseph was the eldest son of Archduke Francis Charles and Sophia, daughter of King Maximilian I of Bavaria. As his uncle Emperor Ferdinand (I) was childless, Franz Joseph was educated as his heir-presumptive. In the spring of 1848 he served with the Austrian forces in Italy, where Lombardy-Venetia, 
                 supported by King Charles Albert of Sardinia, had rebelled against Austrian rule. When revolution spread to the capitals of the Austrian Empire, Franz Joseph was proclaimed emperor at Olmütz (Olomouc) on December 2, 1848, after the abdication of Ferdinand—the rights of his father, the archduke, to the throne having been passed over. Hopes of a revival of monarchist sentiments were raised by his radiant, youthful appearance.
    
                 Of all his mentors, the old chancellor Klemens, Fürst (prince) von Metternich, probably exerted the most lasting influence on Franz Joseph. A more profound influence, however, was that of his wife, the duchess Elizabeth of Bavaria. He married her in 1854 and remained deeply attached to her throughout a stormy marriage.
                 
                 Although he had been raised to be a soldier and wore a uniform all his life, Franz Joseph was no more a strategist than he was a statesman. He made up for this deficiency by the careful study of documents, by an extraordinarily retentive memory, and by being a shrewd judge of character. Invariably well informed and familiar with the reports of his envoys, he was to his civil servants an unequaled model of exactitude, devotion
                  to duty, and justice. In his time Austria-Hungary was credited with having a civil administration that was as efficient as any in Europe. Having reserved for himself the control of foreign policy and of all matters bearing on the army, he stated repeatedly that this foreign policy was his own and that any criticism of it was in reality directed at himself. While loyal to his ministers, he refused to grant them any influence 
                  beyond the limits of their respective offices; once dismissed, a minister was no longer consulted on official business. This attitude, which many considered to be both ungrateful and ungracious, sprang in part from a punctiliousness that was hard to penetrate and rendered him incapable of true friendship. In the early decades of his reign, his correct but unapproachable bearing caused Franz Joseph to be respected but not really 
                  popular. Toward the end of his life, however, he became a universally revered man, a personality that for all its defects and insufficiencies held together the rotting structure of the multinational state.
    
                 Although a gentleman of irresistible charm in personal contact, Franz Joseph was greatly feared as the head of his house. His attitude toward his family was determined primarily by dynastic considerations. His own marriage had been a love match, and he remained devoted to his wife even after the marriage had been wrecked by her eccentricities. Her assassination, in Geneva on September 10, 1898, saddened him profoundly. The tragedy
                  of the heir apparent, the archduke Rudolf, who dramatically shot himself in a suicide love pact with a 17-year-old baroness at Mayerling on January 30, 1889, was assuredly rooted in Rudolf’s unstable character. Yet the emperor had contributed to his only son Rudolf’s instability by giving him an unsuitable education, forcing him to marry Princess Stephanie of Belgium, and dealing with him in an altogether cold and uncomprehending 
                  manner. He treated his daughter-in-law with unforgiving harshness after her second, morganatic marriage, believing that family members who married beneath their station had committed a crime against the dynasty. Furthermore, Franz Joseph never became reconciled to the morganatic union of the next heir presumptive, Archduke Franz Ferdinand. His statements on receiving the report of the archducal couple’s murder at Sarajevo, on June 28,
                   1914, show that he looked upon their fate as a token of divine retribution. These tragedies, which became public knowledge, were underlined by an unending series of sometimes heated family disputes in the course of which Franz Joseph forced the members of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine to conform to his own notion of an archduke’s dignity and position. Yet this man who became ever lonelier as time went on could be a generous and amiable
                    family father to his daughters and those members of the house who bowed to his wishes.
                 
                 The only member of the immediate family with whom he had a closer relationship was his youngest brother, the archduke Louis Victor. While he was no more than correct in his attitude toward his brother, the talented and ambitious archduke Maximilian, he bears no blame for the tragedy that ended Maximilian’s brief interlude as emperor of Mexico.             
                 Having overcome the threat to its survival in 1848–49, Austria passed through a long metamorphosis with many ups and downs in the 68 years that Franz Joseph occupied the throne. His many mistakes were balanced by splendid achievements. The social legislation enacted by the prime minister Eduard, Graf (count) von Taaffe, during the 1880s, the new penal code of 1852, the trade regulations of 1859, and the commercial code of 1862 are all examples
                  of a civil administration that was highly regarded throughout Europe. Those achievements bore the stamp of the emperor’s own silent devotion to duty.
